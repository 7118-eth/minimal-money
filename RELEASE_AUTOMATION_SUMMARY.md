# Release Automation Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Quick Wins ✅
1. **Windows Support**
   - Added Windows builds to release matrix (amd64 & arm64)
   - Disabled CGO for Windows compatibility
   - Proper .exe naming and zip archives

2. **Version Information**
   - Added `--version` flag to binary
   - Shows version, commit hash, and build date
   - Integrated into Makefile for local builds

3. **Dynamic Changelog**
   - Generates changelog from git commits
   - Groups by type (features, fixes, other)
   - Compares with previous tag automatically

4. **Build Improvements**
   - Fixed deprecated GitHub Actions commands
   - Added proper cross-compilation support
   - Consistent naming across platforms

### Phase 2: GoReleaser ✅
1. **Configuration**
   - Complete `.goreleaser.yml` with all platforms
   - Separate builds for CGO/non-CGO targets
   - Professional changelog generation

2. **Workflow**
   - New `release-goreleaser.yml` workflow
   - Automatic cross-compilation setup
   - Single command release process

3. **Developer Experience**
   - `make release-test` for local testing
   - `make release-tag` for version tagging
   - Updated documentation

## Usage

### Standard Release (existing workflow)
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### GoReleaser Release (recommended)
```bash
make release-tag VERSION=v1.1.0
git push origin v1.1.0
```

### Test Version Locally
```bash
make build
./minimal-money --version
```

## Next Steps (Not Implemented)

These require external accounts or additional setup:

### Phase 3: Package Managers
- Homebrew tap (requires separate repository)
- Snap package (requires Snapcraft account)
- AUR package (requires AUR maintainer account)

### Phase 4: Container Support
- Dockerfile creation
- GitHub Container Registry setup
- Multi-arch Docker builds

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- Release signing with cosign
- Automated semantic versioning
- Release drafts
