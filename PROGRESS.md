# Minimal Money - Development Progress

## Current State

### ✅ Fully Implemented
- Complete portfolio tracking application with terminal UI
- Multi-account asset management
- Real-time price fetching from CoinGecko (crypto) and ExchangeRate-API (fiat)
- Database-cached prices with manual update (press 'p')
- Asset-first tree view with account grouping
- Tree visualization across all table columns
- Full terminal width utilization
- Portfolio value calculation with sorting by highest value
- Complete CRUD operations for holdings
- Audit trail system tracking all portfolio changes
- Input validation and error handling
- Comprehensive test suite
- SQLite persistence with GORM

### 🎯 Key Features
1. **Tree-Based UI** - Assets as parent nodes, accounts as children with visual connectors
2. **Price Caching** - Database storage reduces API calls
3. **Audit Trail** - Complete history of additions, edits, and deletions
4. **Smart Sorting** - Assets ordered by total value (highest first)
5. **Responsive Design** - Adapts to terminal width
