# Budget Tracker - Development Progress

## Current State (2025-01-11)

### ✅ Implemented
- Project structure with Go modules
- Complete data models (Account, Asset, Holding with relationships)
- SQLite database with GORM migrations
- Table-based UI with Bubble Tea
- Full input modal for adding assets (account, asset, amount, price)
- Real-time price fetching from CoinGecko and ExchangeRate APIs
- Portfolio value calculation with P&L tracking
- Data persistence - all operations save to database
- Price caching in database with timestamps
- Keyboard navigation (n/e/d/p/h/q/ESC/arrows)
- Comprehensive test suite with real services
- Asset-first table view with tree-like account grouping
- Full terminal width utilization
- Last price update timestamp display
- Audit trail for all portfolio changes

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented
- Edit/Delete operations (UI exists, backend not connected)
- History view (placeholder exists, needs implementation)
- 24h price change tracking (API supports it, not displayed)

### ❌ Not Implemented
- Background price updates (manual refresh only)
- Price history storage and charts
- Export functionality
- Multi-currency support (USD only)
- Stock price integration

## Architecture Highlights
1. **Repository Pattern** - Clean data access layer
2. **Service Layer** - Business logic separated from UI
3. **Real APIs** - CoinGecko for crypto, ExchangeRate for fiat
4. **Pragmatic Testing** - Real SQLite and API calls in tests

## Test Coverage
- Repository Layer: 85.7%
- API Client: 91.7%
- Service Layer: 89.7%
- UI Model: 52.3%
- Overall: 33.1% (focused on business logic)

## Recent Changes (2025-01-11)
1. **Refactored Table View** - Asset-first display with tree-like account grouping
2. **Added Price Caching** - Database storage with timestamps
3. **Changed Price Update** - Manual update with 'p' key (was 'r')
4. **Full Width UI** - Utilizes entire terminal width
5. **Last Update Display** - Shows when prices were last updated
6. **Audit Trail** - Replaced price history with portfolio change tracking

## Previous Changes (2025-01-10)
1. **Added Account Model** - Organize holdings by platform
2. **Implemented Table View** - Replaced menu with always-visible table
3. **Created Input Modal** - Full form with validation
4. **Connected Database** - All CRUD operations working
5. **Integrated Price APIs** - Real-time portfolio valuation
6. **Added Comprehensive Tests** - Pragmatic approach with real services

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Complete Edit/Delete
- [ ] Wire up edit modal to update holdings
- [ ] Implement delete confirmation
- [ ] Add validation for updates

### 2. Price History
- [ ] Store price snapshots in database
- [ ] Implement history view with charts
- [ ] Add time range selection

### 3. Background Updates
- [ ] Add price update goroutine
- [ ] Implement configurable update interval
- [ ] Show last update timestamp

### 4. Export Features
- [ ] CSV export for tax reporting
- [ ] JSON backup/restore
- [ ] Portfolio summary reports

### 5. Enhanced Features
- [ ] Multi-currency support
- [ ] Stock price integration
- [ ] Transaction history
- [ ] Performance analytics

## Known Limitations
1. **API Rate Limits** - Free tier limits for price APIs
2. **No Background Updates** - Manual refresh required
3. **USD Only** - All values converted to USD
4. **No Charts** - Text-only interface

## Testing Strategy
- **Database**: Real SQLite files per test
- **APIs**: Actual CoinGecko/ExchangeRate calls
- **Fast Mode**: `make test-fast` skips API tests
- **Coverage**: Focus on business logic, not helpers

## User Feedback Incorporated
1. ✅ Table view for better overview
2. ✅ Account grouping for organization
3. ✅ P&L tracking with purchase prices
4. ✅ Real-time price updates
5. ⏳ Export functionality (planned)

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Better error handling in UI
- [ ] More comprehensive input validation
- [ ] Refactor modal handling code
- [ ] Add logging system
- [ ] Improve test coverage for UI

The project is now fully functional for tracking a multi-account portfolio with real-time prices and P&L calculations. The pragmatic testing approach ensures everything works with real services.
